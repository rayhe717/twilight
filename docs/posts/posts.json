Back then, she was so skinny that she looked like an ET. Therefore, her name is ET.\n\n\n\nMy little sister, Huihui, was a Ragdoll. One of my humans’ brothers abandoned her, so she moved to live with my other siblings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I had three different kinds of medicine to facilitate my health conditions, but for sure, I was getting better. I even ate three small cans of wet food in only one day after heading back to my home. My humans took good care of me, and now I am kind of back to normal. I am still waiting for an appointment for a follow-up, and I hope everything will be alright.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
