* That's my big brother Peter. He is a 5-year-old Japanese Spitz. 
 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/peter.jpeg")
```

* My older sister was also once a stray cat. She was brought home when she was only two months old. Back then, she was so skinny that she looked like an ET. Therefore, her name is ET. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}

* My little sister, Huihui, was a Ragdoll. One of my humans' brothers abandoned her, so she moved to live with my other siblings. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
